## Instructions for Gemini
- Always review the changelog (`changelog.md`) before starting any new task to understand recent changes and project context.
- After finishing any task, update the changelog (`changelog.md`) with every detail about what was done, how it was done, and why it was done.
- After every successful task, be sure to write down everything in changelog.md in such a way that you can thoroughly understand how you did something, why you did it, and what you did.
