- I have implemented a "Fraud Checker" feature. This feature allows users to check the delivery history of a phone number. It uses an external API to fetch the data and stores it in a local database. A cron job is created to update the data periodically. I have created the necessary files for the model, view, and controller, and also updated the user dashboard with a new menu item. I have also updated the changelog.

- I have created a new menu named "Courier History" in the admin dashboard. This page displays all courier history from the database, with pagination options (50, 100, 500, 1000 rows per page) and a style similar to the SMS history page. I have also fixed a bug where the page was returning blank due to incorrect database connection handling.
